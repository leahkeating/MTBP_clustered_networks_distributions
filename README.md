# This GitHub contains the code used in the following preprint: *need to name the preprint*

## Below we give a description of the files:

- **[functions.R](https://github.com/leahkeating/MTBP_clustered_networks_distributions/blob/main/functions.R):** This file contains many of the functions required to run the other scripts.
- **[joint_distributions_EECC_and_correlation.R](https://github.com/leahkeating/MTBP_clustered_networks_distributions/blob/main/joint_distributions_EECC_and_correlation.R):** This file contains the code for generating the joint distribution of cascade size and cumulative depth. Here we calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient and the edge-disjoint edge clique cover (EECC).
- **[joint_pgf_inversion.py](https://github.com/leahkeating/MTBP_clustered_networks_distributions/blob/main/joint_pgf_inversion.py):** This file contains the inversion function for the joint pgf, used with ``joint_distributions_EECC_and_correlation.R``. 
- **[EECC_on_empirical_networks.R](https://github.com/leahkeating/MTBP_clustered_networks_distributions/blob/main/EECC_on_empirical_networks.R):** This file contains the code for finding the cascade-size distributions for real-world networks, this uses the EECC.
- **[simple_bp_approximation.R](https://github.com/leahkeating/MTBP_clustered_networks_distributions/blob/main/simple_bp_approximation.R):** This file contains an implementation of the SED approximation of the dynamics on an empirical network as described in Appendix A.
- **[lifetime_distribution.R](https://github.com/leahkeating/MTBP_clustered_networks_distributions/blob/main/lifetime_distribution.R):** This file contains the code for finding the distribution of cascade lifetimes theoretically and comparing to simulations.
